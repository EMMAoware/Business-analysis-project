## Project Overview
The databaese of a video gaming company was analysed to discover some insights using SQL and Tableau. This project helps to
demonstrate an understanding of the different types of financial data and data warehouse concepts for business decision-making processes.

### Task One
Generate four SQL queries that are meaningful and demonstrate the strength of data warehousing in supporting decision-makers.

1. Query one

![query_1](query_1)

Rationale

A glance at the numbers over the years indicates a general decline in spectatorship for both regular and VIP spectators since its inception. Figures recorded in 2021, compared to 2016, show a percentage decrease of about 49 percent for regular spectators and 52 percent for VIP spectators. In all, 2020 recorded the lowest turnout for the two categories of spectators. Although the number of spectators has dwindled over the six-year period, the general decline in numbers needs to be investigated and addressed to ensure continued growth and profitability for the company. This query is essential for management to take a decision on ways on improving attendance during events.

2. Query two
   
![query_2](query_2)

Rationale

The cost of returning tickets affects not only monetary costs but also labour time costs. Therefore, the company needs to track the number of tickets that have had to be returned over the years.The data reveals that in 2021, 13,720,944 pounds had to be returned, representing about 24% of the total number of tickets sold. This figure is staggering and erodes the profitability of the company and must be addressed to reduce it significantly. The company must take steps to investigate the reasons why many tickets had to be returned and address them immediately.

3.  Query three

![query_3](query_3)

Rationale

Query three looks at the profitability of merchandise sold at both events. Merchandise plays an essential role in online video games. It can generate additional revenue for game developers and provide fans with a way to show their support for their favourite games.

Although, in comparison, pins, statues, and clothing fall within the four categories of best-selling merchandise both during online games and the biannual competitions, a more worrying observation from the data is the amount of money tied to merchandise in inventory.  While pins remained the highest-selling merchandise during events and online, a staggering 2,321,668 pounds of pins were left unsold online. From 2016 to 2021, the amount of money locked up from stocking pins was more than that generated after selling pins online for the same period.

This phenomenon applies to the stocking and sale of merchandise both online and at events and requires swift decision-making to resolve it. In addition to causing capital to be tied up, inventory loses value over time leading to an eventual loss of revenue


4.  Query four

![query_4](query_4)

Rationale

A look at the development of video games shows seeming changes in the quality of graphics, colours, character development, and diversity of cultures, among others. In 2023, it is estimated that the average age of a gamer is 34. Although the data collected in 2021 indicated that the maximum age of users was 28, the data currently available indicates that there is a population segment of persons aged 30 and older that may be studied and targeted to optimize profit. 
User acquisition initiatives require a thorough understanding of one's target market and current user base.

The data further reveals that gender does not follow the stereotypical gender representation. Thus, the use of avatars which represents the control and creation of virtual characters representative of an embodiment or extension of self, where a player is able to “have experiences that can be very similar to or different from his or her real-life persona,” (Wood & Szymanski, citing Mancini & Sibilla, 2020, p. 124) has become the norm. 

The company must take steps to create and improve inclusivity in its player-controlled and non-player-controlled characters to attract user groups and communities that may be historically marginalized as a means of growing its user base which would in turn affect profit positively.
